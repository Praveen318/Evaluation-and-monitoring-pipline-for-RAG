The vascular systems, flow -\\ners and leaves of the two types \\nof plants also differ (Table 1). \\nThese differences will be im -\\nportant in our discussion of \\nplant growth and develop -\\nment.\\nPlant life cycles\\nA plant is classified as either an \\nannual, biennial or perennial based on \\nits life cycle or how many years it takes \\nto produce flowers and seeds.\\nAn annual,  such as a marigold, completes \\nits life cycle in 1 year. Annuals go from \\nseed to seed in 1 year or growing season. \\nDuring this period, they germinate, grow, \\nmature, bloom, produce seeds and die. \\nSummer annuals complete their life cycle \\nduring spring and summer; most winter an -\\nnuals complete their growing season during \\nfall and winter. There are both winter and \\nsummer annual weeds, and understanding a \\nweed’s life cycle is important in controlling \\nit. Of course, in most locations in Alaska \\nthe temperature does not allow for winter \\nannuals. Some plants that are winter annu -\\nals in warmer climates act as summer annu -\\nals in Alaska.\\nA biennial  completes its life cycle in 2 \\nyears. During the first season, it produces \\nvegetative structures (leaves) and food stor -\\nage organs. The plant overwinters and then \\nproduces flowers, fruit and seeds during its \\nsecond season. Swiss chard, carrots, beets, \\nsweet William and parsley are examples of \\nbiennials.\\nBiennials can sometimes go from seed \\ngermination to seed production in one grow -\\ning season. This phenomenon is referred \\nto as bolting. It is a common occurrence in \\nAlaska due to the midnight sun, or long day lengths. This is one reason why spin -\\nach, radish and beets can be hard \\ncrops to grow in Alaska. These \\nplants bolt instead of produc -\\ning a good crop of leaves \\nor roots. This situation can \\nalso occur when plants are \\nexposed to extreme envi -\\nronmental conditions such \\nas temperature variation and \\ndrought.\\nPerennial  plants live more than 2 \\nyears and are grouped into two categories: \\nherbaceous perennials and woody perennials. \\nHerbaceous perennials  have soft, non-\\nwoody stems that generally die back to the \\nground each winter. New stems grow from \\nthe plant’s crown each spring. A delphinium \\nis an example of an herbaceous plant. Trees \\nand shrubs, on the other hand, have woody \\nstems that withstand cold winter tempera -\\ntures. They are referred to as woody peren -\\nnials .\\nInternal plant parts\\nCells are the basic structural and physi -\\nological units of plants. Most plant reac -\\ntions (cell division, photosynthesis, respira -\\ntion, etc.) occur at the cellular level. Plant \\ntissues  are organized groups of similar cells \\nthat work together to perform a specific \\nfunction. An example would be the xylem, \\nwhich functions to move the water through \\na plant or the phloem that moves food. \\nPlant cells are totipotent . In other words, \\nplant cells retain all of the genetic informa -\\ntion (encoded in DNA) necessary to devel -\\nop into a complete plant.

This characteristic \\nalso allow growers to utilize tissue culture to \\npropagate disease-free potatoes, orchids, etc. \\nSpecialized groups of cells or tissue \\ncalled meristems/meristematic tissues  are a \\nplant’s growing points. Meristems are the \\nsite of rapid, almost continuous cell divi -\\nsion. These cells either continue to divide or \\ndifferentiate into tissues and organs. How \\nthey divide is controlled by a complex ar -\\nray of plant hormones and environmental \\nconditions. Meristems can be manipulated \\nto change plant growth patterns, flowering, \\nbranching or vegetative growth. \\nExternal plant parts\\nExternal plant structures such as leaves, \\nstems, roots, flowers, fruits and seeds are \\nknown as plant organs. Each organ is an or -\\nganized group of tissues that work together \\nto perform a specific function. These struc -\\ntures can be divided into two groups: sexual \\nreproductive and vegetative. Sexual repro -\\nductive parts  produce seed; they include \\nflower buds, flowers, fruit and seeds. Veg-\\netative parts  (Figure 1) include roots, stems, \\nshoots, nodes, buds and leaves; they are not \\ndirectly involved in sexual reproduction. \\nVegetative parts often are used in asexual \\nforms of reproduction such as cuttings, bud -\\nding or grafting. \\nRoots\\nOften roots are overlooked, probably \\nbecause they are less visible than the rest of \\nthe plant. However, it’s important to under -\\nstand plant root systems because they have \\na pronounced effect on a plant’s size and \\nvigor, method of propagation, adaptation to \\nsoil types and response to cultural practices \\nand irrigation. Roots typically originate from the lower \\nportion of a plant or cutting. They have \\na root cap, but lack nodes and never bear \\nleaves or flowers directly. Their principal \\nfunctions are to absorb nutrients and mois -\\nture, anchor the plant in the soil, support the \\nstem and store food. In some plants, roots \\ncan be used for propagation.\\nStructure\\nInternally, there are three major parts of a \\nroot (Figure 2): \\n yThe meristematic zone  is at the tip and \\nmanufactures new cells; it is an area of \\ncell division and growth. \\nFigure 1.—Principal parts of a vascular plant.

As \\nthey grow, they push the root through \\nthe soil. \\n yThe zone of maturation  is directly be -\\nneath the stem. Here, cells become spe -\\ncific tissues such as epidermis, cortex or \\nvascular tissue. \\nA root’s epidermis  is its outermost layer \\nof cells (Figure 3). These cells are respon -\\nsible for absorbing water and minerals \\ndissolved in water. Cortex  cells are involved \\nin moving water from the epidermis to the \\nvascular tissue (xylem and phloem) and in \\nstoring food. Vascular tissue, located in the \\ncenter of the root, conducts food and water.\\nExternally, there are two areas of impor -\\ntance: the root cap and the root hairs (Figure \\n2). The  root cap  is the root’s outermost tip. \\nIt consists of cells that are sloughed off as \\nthe root grows through the soil. Its function \\nis to protect the root meristem. \\nRoot hairs  are delicate, elongated epi -\\ndermal cells that occur in a small zone \\njust behind the root’s growing tip. They \\ngenerally resemble fine down to the naked \\neye. Their function is to increase the root’s \\nsurface area and absorptive capacity. Root \\nhairs usually live 1 or 2 days. When a plant \\nis transplanted, they are easily torn off or \\nmay dry out in the sun. \\nMany roots have naturally occurring sym-\\nbiotic  (mutually beneficial) relationships \\nwith certain fungi. Fungi grow inside plant \\nroots and in the surrounding soil helping to \\nfacilitate mineral uptake. The fungi hyphae \\n(threadlike cells of the fungus) growing \\nthrough the soil increase the area available \\nfor the absorption of water and nutrients. \\nPlants provide carbohydrates (the products \\nfrom photosynthesis) or food for the fungi. \\nThis beneficial association is called mycor -\\nrhizae  (fungus + root). There are two types of mycorrhizal fungi, \\nectotrophic mycorrhizae and vesicular-\\narbuscular mycorrhizae. Ectotrophic typi -\\ncally form a thick sheath of fungal hyphae \\naround the roots with some of the fungal \\nmycelium growing between cortical cells. \\nThe ectotrophic fungi do not penetrate the \\ncells.

Garden seeds such as peas, \\nbeans and clover are inoculated with nitro -\\ngen fixing bacteria when planted. Because \\ninoculums are living organisms they must \\nbe fresh and handled properly. \\nTypes of roots\\nThere are two major types of roots: pri -\\nmary and lateral roots.\\nA primary  root originates at the lower \\nend of a seedling’s embryo (Figure 2). A \\nprimary root is called a taproot if it continues \\nto elongate downward, has limited secondary \\nbranching and becomes the central feature of \\nthe root system (Figure 4a). Dandelions and \\ncarrots have taproots. \\nA lateral , or secondary, root is a side \\nroot that arises from another root. A fibrous  \\nroot system is formed if the primary root \\nceases to elongate and produces numerous \\nlateral roots (Figure 4b). These lateral roots \\nbranch repeatedly to form the network of \\nfeeding roots found on most plants. Some \\nplants, such as grasses, naturally produce a \\nfibrous root system. In other cases, sever -\\ning a plant’s taproot by undercutting it can \\nencourage the plant to produce a fibrous \\nroot system. Nurseries use this technique \\nwith trees that naturally produce a taproot \\nbecause trees with a compact fibrous root \\nsystem transplant more successfully.How roots grow\\nDuring early development, a seedling \\nabsorbs nutrients and moisture from the soil \\naround the sprouting seed. A band of fertil -\\nizer several inches to each side and slightly \\nbelow newly planted seeds helps early \\ngrowth of most row crops. \\nAs a plant becomes established, the quan -\\ntity and distribution of its roots strongly \\ninfluence its ability to absorb moisture and \\nnutrients. For most plants, the majority of \\nthe absorbing (feeder) roots are located in \\nthe top 6–12 inches of soil. In Alaska \\nplants growing on permafrost are close \\nto the surface. The cold soils reduce \\ndeep root development.\\nThe following factors are important \\nin root growth: \\n yRoots in water-saturated soil do not \\ngrow well and may die due to lack of \\noxygen. \\n yRoots penetrate deeper in loose, well-\\ndrained soil than in heavy, poorly \\ndrained soil. \\n yDense, compacted soil layers can re -\\nstrict or terminate root growth. \\n yContainer plants not only have a re -\\nstricted area for root growth, but also are \\nsusceptible to cold damage because the \\nlimited amount of soil surrounding roots \\nreduces insulation.\\n yIn addition to growing downward, roots \\ngrow laterally and often extend well \\nbeyond a plant’s drip line. Keep this \\nextensive root system in mind when \\ndisturbing the soil around existing trees \\nand shrubs.\\nRoots as food\\nSeveral vegetable crops are enlarged \\nroots.

Stems place the \\nleaves in favorable positions for exposure to \\nlight. The vascular system inside the stem \\nforms a continuous pathway from the root, \\nthrough the stem, and finally to the leaves. \\nIt is through this system that water and food \\nproducts move.\\nStructure\\nVascular system\\nThe vascular system consists of xylem, \\nphloem and vascular cambium. It can be \\nthought of as a plant’s plumbing. Xylem  \\ntubes conduct water and dissolved miner -\\nals; phloem  tubes carry food such as sugars. \\nThe cambium  is a layer of meristematic \\ntissue that separates the xylem and phloem \\nand continuously produces new xylem and \\nphloem cells. This new tissue is responsible \\nfor a stem’s increase in girth. \\nThe vascular cambium is important to \\ngardeners in several ways. Xylem and phloem \\ntissues on a grafted scion (top wood) and \\nrootstock need to line up, if the graft is to \\ntake. Careless weed trimming can strip the \\nbark off a tree, injuring the cambium and \\ngirdling the tree and causing it to die. This \\noften occurs when string weed trimmers are used to remove grass from around the trunk \\nof trees. Stem boring insects are attracted to \\ncuts made by weed trimmers. \\nThe vascular systems of monocots and \\ndicots differ (Figure 5). Although both con -\\ntain xylem and phloem, these structures are \\narranged differently in each. In a monocot, \\nthe xylem and phloem are paired in bundles \\ndispersed throughout the stem. The vascular \\nsystem in dicots is said to be continuous \\nbecause it forms rings inside the stem. The \\nphloem forms the outer ring and eventu -\\nally becomes part of the bark in mature \\nwoody stems. The xylem forms the inner \\nring. Sapwood is newer xylem that is still \\nconducting and heartwood is older xylem \\nthat is crushed in the center of the stem and \\nis no longer conducting. Heartwood is filled \\nwith waste materials such as gums, resins, \\ntannins and oils.\\nThe difference in the vascular systems of \\nmonocots and dicots is of practical inter -\\nest to gardeners because some herbicides \\naffect only one group.

Generally, you want to cut \\njust above, but not too close to, a node. \\nPruning in this manner encourages the buds \\nat that node to begin development and ulti -\\nmately form new stems or leaves. \\nThe area between nodes is called the \\ninternode . Its length depends on many fac -\\ntors, including genetics. Other factors also \\ncan influence internode length:\\n yReduced soil fertility decreases inter-\\nnode length, while an application of \\nhigh-nitrogen fertilizer can increase it. \\n yLack of light increases internode length \\ncausing spindly stems. This situation \\nis known as stretch, or etiolation, and \\noften occurs in seedlings started indoors \\nand in houseplants under low light con -\\nditions\\n yInternode length varies seasonally. \\nEarly-season growth has long inter -\\nnodes; late-season growth has shorter \\ninternodes. \\n yPlant energy divided among three or \\nfour side stems, or diverted into fruit \\ngrowth and development, shortens inter -\\nnode length.  yPlant growth regulator substances and \\nherbicides also can influence internode \\nlength.\\nTypes of stems\\nStems may be long with great distances \\nbetween nodes (e.g., branches of trees, \\nrunners on strawberries) or compressed, \\nwith short distances between nodes (e.g., \\ncrowns of strawberry plants, fruit spurs, and \\nAfrican violets). Although stems commonly \\ngrow above ground, they sometimes grow \\nbelow ground in the form of rhizomes, \\ntubers, corms or bulbs. All stems must have \\nbuds or leaves.\\nSpecialized aboveground stems\\nSome plants have specialized above-\\nground stems known as crowns, spurs or \\nstolons (Figure 7). Crowns  (on strawber -\\nries, dandelions and African violets) are \\ncompressed stems with leaves and flowers \\non short internodes. Spurs  are short, stubby \\nside stems that arise from a main stem. \\nThey are the fruit-bearing stems on pear, \\napple and cherry trees. If severe pruning is \\ndone too close to fruit-bearing spurs, they \\ncan revert to nonfruiting stems, thus elimi -\\nnating the year’s potential fruit crop. \\nStolons  are fleshy or semiwoody, elongat -\\ned, horizontal stems that often lie along the \\nsoil surface.

Some \\nrhizomes are compressed and fleshy (e.g., \\niris), while others are slender and have \\nelongated internodes (e.g., bluegrass). Some \\ngrasses are insidious weeds principally \\nbecause of the spreading capability of their \\nrhizomes.\\nTulips, lilies and onions produce bulbs , \\nwhich are shortened, compressed under -\\nground stems surrounded by fleshy scales \\n(leaves) that envelop a central bud at the \\ntip of the stem. In late August you can cut \\na tulip or lily bulb in half and see all of the \\nflower parts in miniature.\\nAfter a bulb-producing plant flowers, its \\nphloem transports food reserves from the \\nleaves to the bulb’s scales. When the bulb begins growing in the spring, it utilizes the \\nstored food. For this reason, it is important \\nnot to remove the leaves from lilies and \\nother bulb producing plants until after they \\nhave turned yellow or had sufficient time to \\ngrow. In late summer and early fall, these \\nplants store food for next year’s flowering. \\nThere are two types of bulbs: tunicate and \\nnontunicate (Figure 8). Tunicate  bulbs (e.g., \\ntulips and onions) have a thin, papery cov -\\nering, which actually is a modified leaf. It \\nhelps protect the bulb from damage during \\ndigging and from drying out once it is out \\nof the soil. Nontunicate bulbs (e.g., lilies) \\ndo not have this papery covering.

They may be either active or dormant. \\nUnder the right conditions, they will de -\\nvelop into stems or leaves.\\nA leaf blade is composed of several lay -\\ners (Figure 12). On the top and bottom is a \\nlayer of thick, tough cells called the epider -\\nmis. Its primary function is to protect the \\nother layers of leaf tissue. The arrangement \\nof epidermal cells determines the leaf’s \\nsurface texture. Some leaves, such as those \\nof African violets, have hairs ( pubescence ), \\nwhich are extensions of epidermal cells that \\nmake the leaves feel like velvet. \\nThe cuticle  is part of the epidermis. It \\nproduces a waxy layer called cutin , which \\nprotects the leaf from dehydration and dis -\\nease. The amount of cutin on a leaf increas -\\nes with increasing light intensity. For this \\nreason, when moving plants from shade into \\nfull sunlight, do so gradually over a period \\nof a few weeks. This gradual exposure to \\nsunlight is referred to as hardening off. It al -\\nlows the cutin layer to build up and protect \\nthe leaves from rapid water loss or sun -\\nscald. Transplants produced indoors should \\nbe hardened off before planting outdoors.\\nThe waxy cutin also repels water. For \\nthis reason, many pesticides contain a spray \\nadditive (sticker, spreader, etc.) to help the \\nproduct adhere to, or penetrate, the cutin \\nlayer. \\nSpecial epidermal cells called guard cells  \\nopen and close in response to environmen -\\ntal stimuli such as changes in weather and \\nlight. They regulate the passage of water, \\noxygen and carbon dioxide into and out of \\nthe leaf through tiny openings called sto-\\nmata . In most species, the majority of the \\nstomata are located on the undersides of \\nleaves.\\nConditions that would cause plants to \\nlose a lot of water (high temperature, low \\nhumidity) stimulate guard cells to close. In mild weather, they remain open. Guard cells \\nalso close in the absence of light.\\nLocated between the upper and lower \\nepidermis is the mesophyll . It is divided into \\na dense upper layer ( palisade mesophyll ) \\nand a lower layer that contains lots of air \\nspace ( spongy mesophyll ). Located within \\nthe mesophyll cells are chloroplasts, where \\nphotosynthesis takes place. \\nTypes of leaves\\nThere are many kinds of leaves. The \\nmost common and conspicuous leaves are \\nreferred to as foliage and are the primary \\nlocation of photosynthesis. However, there \\nare many other types of modified leaves: \\n yScale leaves (cataphylls) are found on \\nrhizomes and buds, which they enclose \\nand protect. \\n ySeed leaves  (cotyledons) are found on \\nembryonic plants. They store food for \\nthe developing seedling. \\n ySpines and tendrils , such as those on \\nbarberry and pea plants, protect a plant \\nor help support its stems. \\n yStorage leaves,  such as those on bul -\\nbous plants and succulents, store food. \\n yBracts  often are brightly colored modi -\\nfied leaves. The showy structures on \\ndogwoods and poinsettias are bracts, not \\npetals.\\nVenation\\nThe vascular bundles of xylem and \\nphloem extend from the stem, through the \\npetiole and into the leaf blade as veins. \\nThe term venation  refers to how veins are \\ndistributed in the blade. There are two prin -\\ncipal types of venation: parallel-veined and \\nnet-veined (Figure 13). \\nIn parallel-veined  leaves, numerous veins \\nrun parallel to each other and are con -\\nnected laterally by minute, straight veinlets. \\nParallel-veined leaves occur most often on ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/RAI_1/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

The most com -\\nmon type of parallel veining is found in \\nplants of the grass family, whose veins run \\nfrom the leaf’s base to its apex. Another \\ntype of parallel venation is found in plants \\nsuch as banana, calla and pickerelweed. \\nTheir veins run laterally from the midrib. \\nIn net-veined  leaves (also called reticu -\\nlate-veined ), veins branch from the main \\nrib or ribs and subdivide into finer veinlets. \\nThese veinlets then unite in a complicated \\nnetwork. This system of enmeshed veins \\nmakes the leaf more resistant to tearing than \\ndoes a parallel vein structure. Net-veined \\nleaves occur on dicotyledonous plants.\\nNet venation may be either pinnate or \\npalmate. In pinnate  venation, the veins \\nextend laterally from the midrib to the \\nedge (e.g., apples, cherries and peaches). In \\npalmate  venation, the principal veins extend \\noutward, like the ribs of a fan, from the base \\nof the leaf blade (e.g., grapes and maples). \\nLeaves as plant identifiers\\nLeaves are useful for plant identifica -\\ntion. A leaf’s shape, base, apex and margin \\ncan be important identifying characteristics \\n(Figures 14–16). \\nLeaf type (Figure 17) also is important \\nfor identification. There are two types of \\nleaves: simple and compound. In simple  leaves, the leaf blade is a single, continu -\\nous unit. Compound  leaves are composed \\nof several separate leaflets arising from the \\nsame petiole. Some leaves are doubly com -\\npound. Leaf type can be confusing because \\na deeply lobed simple leaf may look like a \\ncompound leaf. \\nLeaf arrangement along a stem also is \\nused in plant identification (Figure 18). \\nThere are four types of leaf arrangement: \\n yOpposite  leaves are positioned across \\nthe stem from each other, with two \\nleaves at each node. \\n yAlternate  (spiral) leaves are arranged in \\nalternate steps along the stem, with only \\none leaf at each node. \\n yWhorled  leaves are arranged in circles \\nalong the stem. \\n yRosulate  leaves are arranged in a rosette \\naround a stem with extremely short \\nnodes. \\nLeaves as food\\nThe leaf blade is the edible part of several \\nhorticultural crops, including chives, col -\\nlards, endive, kale, leaf lettuce, mustard, \\nparsley, spinach, Swiss chard and other \\ngreens.

Fragrance and color attract \\npollinators (insects or birds) that play an \\nimportant role in the reproductive process.\\nFlowers are important for plant classifica -\\ntion. The system of plant nomenclature we \\nuse today was developed by Carl von Linné \\n(Linnaeus) and is based on flowers and/or \\nreproductive parts of plants. One reason his \\nsystem is successful is because flowers are \\nthe plant part least influenced by environ -\\nmental changes. Thus, knowledge of flow -\\ners and their parts is essential for anyone \\ninterested in plant identification.\\nStructure\\nFlowers contain a stamen (male flower \\npart) and/or pistil (female flower part), plus \\naccessory parts such as sepals, petals and \\nnectar glands (Figure 19). \\nThe stamen  is the male reproductive or -\\ngan. It consists of a pollen sac ( anther ) and \\na long supporting filament. This filament holds the anther in position, making the \\npollen available for dispersement by wind, \\ninsects, or birds. \\nThe pistil  is a plant’s female part. It \\ngenerally is shaped like a bowling pin and \\nis located in the flower’s center. It consists \\nof a stigma, style and ovary. The stigma  is \\nlocated at the top and is connected by the \\nstyle to the ovary. The ovary  contains eggs, \\nwhich reside in ovules. If an egg is fertil -\\nized, the ovule develops into a seed.\\nSepals  are small, green, leaf-like struc -\\ntures located at the base of a flower. They \\nprotect the flower bud. Collectively, the \\nsepals are called a calyx . \\nPetals are the highly colored portions of \\na flower. Like nectar glands, petals may \\ncontain perfume. Collectively, the petals are \\ncalled a corolla . The number of petals on a \\nflower is used to help identify plant families \\nand genera. Flowers of dicots typically have \\nfour or five sepals and/or petals, or multiples \\nthereof. In monocots, these floral parts typi -\\ncally come in threes or multiples of three.\\nTypes of flowers\\nIf a flower has a stamen, pistil, petals and \\nsepals, it is called a complete  flower (Figure \\n19).

Staminate  (male) flowers \\ncontain stamens, but no pistils. \\nPlants with imperfect flowers are fur -\\nther classified as monoecious or dioecious. \\nMonoecious  plants have separate male and \\nfemale flowers on the same plant (e.g., corn \\nand pecans). Monoecious is sometimes re -\\nferred to as one house for both sexes. Some \\nmonoecious plants bear only male flowers \\nat the beginning of the growing season, but \\nlater develop both sexes (e.g., cucumbers \\nand squash). \\nDioecious  species have separate male and \\nfemale plants. Examples include kiwi, gink -\\ngos and cottonwood. In order to set fruit, \\nmale and female plants must be planted \\nclose enough together for pollination to \\noccur. In some instances the fruit is desir -\\nable. In the case of ginkgos, the fruit is not \\ndesirable due to its putrid smell when ripe. \\nKiwis are complicated because they may \\nhave one plant with bisexual flowers and \\nanother plant with only male flowers. The \\nplant world doesn’t always have absolutes!\\nTypes of inflorescences\\nSome plants bear only one flower per \\nstem, which is called a solitary  flower. Oth -\\ner plants produce an inflorescence , a cluster \\nof flowers. Each flower in an inflorescence \\nis called a floret. Most inflorescences belong to one of two \\ngroups: racemes and cymes. In the race-\\nmose  group, the florets start blooming from \\nthe bottom of the stem and progress toward \\nthe top. In a cyme , the top floret opens first \\nand blooms progress downward along the \\nstem. Detailed discussions of flower types \\nare found in many botany textbooks. (See \\n“For more information” at the end of this \\nchapter.)\\nHow seeds form\\nPollination  is the transfer of pollen from \\nan anther to a stigma, either by wind or \\npollinators. Species pollinated by insects, \\nanimals or birds often have brightly colored \\nor patterned flowers that contain fragrance \\nor nectar. While searching for nectar, polli -\\nnators transfer pollen from flower to flower, \\neither on the same plant or on different \\nplants. Plants evolved this ingenious mech -\\nanism to ensure species survival. \\nIn Alaska, cool-wet conditions can reduce \\nthe flight of pollinators. This can be the \\ncause of a small blueberry crop, which de -\\npends on insect pollination. Zucchini flow -\\ners, which are normally pollinated by bees, \\nmay have to be hand pollinated in cool wet \\nsummers. Wind-pollinated flowers often \\nlack showy floral parts and nectar because \\nthey don’t need to attract pollinators. \\nA chemical in the stigma stimulates \\npollen to grow a long tube down the style \\nto the ovules inside the ovary. The stigma \\nrecognizes pollen, which has a chemical \\nspecific to that type of plant.

Cross-pollinated \\nplants usually are more successful than self-\\npollinated plants. Consequently, more plants \\nreproduce by cross than by self-pollination.\\nFruit\\nStructure\\nFruit consists of fertilized, mature ovules \\n(seeds) plus the ovary wall. Fruit may be \\nfleshy, as in an apple, or dry and hard, as \\nin an acorn. In some fruits, the seeds are \\nenclosed within the ovary (e.g., apples, \\npeaches, oranges, squash and cucumbers). \\nIn others, seeds are situated on the outside \\nof fruit tissue (e.g., corn and strawberries).\\nThe only part of the fruit that contains \\ngenes from both the male and female flow -\\ners is the seed. The rest of the fruit arises \\nfrom the maternal plant and is genetically \\nidentical to it. \\nTypes of fruit\\nFruits are classified as simple, aggre -\\ngate or multiple (Figure 21). Simple  fruits \\ndevelop from a single ovary. They include \\nfleshy fruits such as cherries and peaches \\n(drupe), pears and apples (pome) and toma -\\ntoes (berries). Although generally referred \\nto as a vegetable, tomatoes technically are \\na fruit because they develop from a flower. \\nSquash, cucumbers and eggplants also de -\\nvelop from a single ovary and are classified \\nbotanically as fruits. Other types of simple fruit are dry. Their \\nwall is either papery or leathery and hard, \\nas opposed to the fleshy examples just \\nmentioned. Examples are peanuts (legume), \\npoppies (capsule), maples (samara) and \\nwalnuts (nut).\\nAn aggregate  fruit develops from a single \\nflower with many ovaries. Examples are \\nstrawberries, raspberries and blackber -\\nries. The flower is a simple flower with \\none corolla, one calyx and one stem, but \\nit has many pistils or ovaries. Each ovary \\nis fertilized separately. If some ovules are \\nnot pollinated successfully, the fruit will be \\nmisshapen.\\nMultiple  fruits are derived from a tight \\ncluster of separate, independent flowers \\nborne on a single structure. Each flower has \\nits own calyx and corolla. Pineapples and \\nfigs are examples. \\nFruit as food\\nSome foods that we call vegetables are \\nactually fruit. A ripened, mature ovary that \\ncontains seeds is a fruit.

Chloroplasts are arranged per -\\npendicular to incoming sun rays to absorb \\nmaximum sunlight.\\nPhotosynthesis stops if any of the ingre -\\ndients for photosynthesis — light, water and \\ncarbon dioxide — are lacking. If any factor \\nis absent for a long period of time, a plant \\nwill die.

This energy is used for cell growth \\nand building new tissues. The chemical \\nprocess by which sugars and starches are \\nconverted to energy is called oxidation . It \\nis similar to the burning of wood or coal \\nto produce heat. Controlled oxidation in a \\nliving cell is called respiration  and is shown \\nby this equation:\\nC6H12O6 + 6O2 = 6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy\\nThis equation is essentially the oppo -\\nsite of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is \\na building process, while respiration is a \\nbreaking-down process (Table 2). Unlike \\nphotosynthesis, respiration does not depend \\non light, so it occurs at night as well as \\nduring the day. Respiration occurs in all life \\nforms and in all cells. \\nTranspiration\\nWhen a leaf’s guard cells shrink, the \\nstomata open and water vapor is lost. This \\nprocess is called transpiration . Evaporating \\nwater causes a negative water pressure in \\nthe plant and more water is pulled up from \\nthe roots. Dissolved nutrients are pulled in \\nwith the water from the roots. The rate of \\ntranspiration is directly related to whether \\nstomata are open or closed. Stomata ac -count for only 1 percent of a leaf’s surface \\nbut 90 percent of the water transpired.\\nTranspiration is a necessary process and \\nuses about 90 percent of the water that \\nenters a plant’s roots. The other 10 percent \\nis used in chemical reactions and in plant \\ntissues. Water moving via the transpiration \\nstream is responsible for several things: \\n yTransporting minerals from the soil \\nthroughout the plant \\n yCooling the plant through evaporation\\n yMoving sugars and plant chemicals \\n yMaintaining cell firmness \\nThe amount and rate of water loss de -\\npends on factors such as temperature, \\nhumidity and wind or air movement. Tran -\\nspiration is greatest in hot, dry (low relative \\nhumidity), windy weather. \\nA balancing act\\nIn order for a plant to grow and develop \\nproperly, it must balance photosynthesis, \\nrespiration and transpiration. Left to their \\nown devices, plants do a good job of man -\\naging this intricate balance. If a plant photo -\\nsynthesizes at a high rate, but its respiration \\nrate is not high enough to break down the \\nphotosynthates produced, photosynthesis \\nwill either slow down or stop. On the other \\nhand, if respiration is much more rapid \\nthan photosynthesis, the plant won’t have \\nadequate photosynthates to produce energy \\nfor growth. Hence, growth either will slow \\ndown or stop altogether.\\nWhen stomata are open, transpiration \\noccurs, sometimes at a very high rate. A \\ncorn plant may transpire 50 gallons of water \\nper season, but a large tree may move 100 \\ngallons per day! Plants have problems if \\nthey lose too much water, so stomata close \\nduring hot, dry periods when transpiration \\nis highest. However, CO2, needed for photo -\\nsynthesis, also enters the plant through open Table 2.—Photosynthesis and respiration.\\nPhotosynthesis Respiration\\n• Produces food. • Uses food.\\n• Stores energy. • Releases energy.\\n• Uses water. • Produces water.\\n• Uses carbon  • Produces carbon  \\n dioxide.  dioxide.\\n• Releases oxygen. • Uses oxygen.\\n• Occurs in sunlight. • Occurs in dark as  \\n   well as in light.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/RAI_1/pdf2.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

As a result, photosynthesis and \\nrespiration will slow down, reducing plant \\ngrowth. \\nMany herb plants produce high-energy oils \\nto help them survive in the dry landscapes \\nwhere they evolved. Oils help plants survive \\nextended periods of stomatal closure. \\nEnvironmental factors affecting \\ngrowth\\nThe environment affects plant growth and \\ngeographic distribution. If any environmen -\\ntal factor is less than ideal, it limits a plant’s \\ngrowth and/or distribution. For example, \\nonly plants adapted to limited amounts of \\nwater can live in deserts. \\nEither directly or indirectly, most plant \\nproblems are caused by environmental \\nstress. In some cases, poor environmental \\nconditions (e.g., too little water) damage a \\nplant directly. In other cases, environmental \\nstress weakens a plant and makes it more \\nsusceptible to disease or insect attack. \\nEnvironmental factors that affect plant \\ngrowth include light, temperature, water, \\nhumidity and nutrition. It is important to \\nunderstand how these factors affect plant \\ngrowth and development. With a basic \\nunderstanding of these factors, a plant can \\nbe manipulated to meet your needs for in -\\ncreased leaf, flower or fruit production. By \\nrecognizing the roles of these factors, you \\ncan better diagnose plant problems caused \\nby environmental stress. \\nLight\\nThree principal characteristics of light af -\\nfect plant growth: quantity, quality and dura -\\ntion (how much, what type and how long).Quantity\\nLight quantity is the intensity, or con -\\ncentration, of sunlight. It varies with the \\nseasons. The maximum amount of light is \\npresent in summer, and the minimum in \\nwinter. Up to a point, the more sunlight a \\nplant receives, the greater its capacity for \\nproducing food via photosynthesis. \\nLight quantity can be manipulated to \\nachieve different plant growth patterns. \\nIncrease light by surrounding plants with \\nreflective materials, a white background or \\nsupplemental lights.

Sunlight supplies the \\ncomplete range of wavelengths and can be \\nbroken up by a prism into bands of red, or -\\nange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. \\nBlue and red light is absorbed by plants \\nand has the greatest effect on growth. Blue \\nlight is responsible for vegetative (leaf) \\ngrowth. Red light, when combined with \\nblue light, encourages flowering. Plants \\nlook green because they reflect, rather than \\nabsorb, green light. This means that plants \\ndo not use green light for growth.\\nKnowing which light source to use is im -\\nportant for manipulating plant growth. For \\nexample, fluorescent (cool white) light is \\nhigh in the blue wavelength. It encourages \\nleafy growth and is excellent for starting \\nseedlings. Incandescent light is high in the \\nred or orange range, but generally produces \\ntoo much heat to be a valuable light source \\nfor plants. Fluorescent grow lights attempt \\nto imitate sunlight with a mixture of red and \\nblue wavelengths, but they are costly and \\ngenerally no better than regular fluorescent \\nlights.\\nDuration\\nDuration, or photoperiod , refers to the \\namount of time a plant is exposed to light. \\nPhotoperiod controls flowering in many \\nplants (Figure 26). Scientists initially \\nthought the length of light period triggered \\nflowering and other responses within plants. \\nThus, they describe plants as short-day or \\nlong-day, depending on what conditions \\nthey flower under. We now know that it is \\nnot the length of the light period, but rather \\nthe length of uninterrupted darkness, that is \\ncritical to floral development. \\nPlants are classified into three categories: \\nshort-day (long-night), long-day (short-\\nnight) or day-neutral, depending on their response to the duration of light or dark -\\nness. Short-day  plants form flowers only \\nwhen day length is less than about 12 hours. \\nMany spring and fall-flowering plants, such \\nas chrysanthemums, poinsettias and Christ -\\nmas cactus, are in this category. \\nIn contrast, long-day  plants form flow -\\ners only when day length exceeds 12 hours. \\nMost summer-flowering plants (e.g., rud -\\nbeckia, California poppies and asters), as \\nwell as many vegetables (beets, radishes, \\nlettuce, spinach and potatoes), are in this \\ncategory. Alaska summers are full of long-\\nday conditions.\\nDay-neutral plants form flowers regard -\\nless of day length. Examples are tomatoes, \\ncorn, cucumbers and some strawberry culti -\\nvars. Some plants do not fit into any cat -\\negory, but may respond to combinations of \\nday lengths. Petunias, for example, flower \\nregardless of day length, they but flower \\nearlier and more profusely with long days. \\nYou can easily manipulate photoperiod to \\nstimulate flowering. For example, chrysan -\\nthemums normally flower in the short days \\nof spring or fall, but bloom in midsummer \\nwhen covered with a cloth that completely \\nblocks out light for 12 hours each day. After \\nseveral weeks of this treatment, the artificial \\ndark period is no longer needed, and the \\nplants will bloom as if it were spring or fall. \\nThis method also is used to make poinset -\\ntias flower in time for Christmas. \\nTo bring a long-day plant into flower \\nwhen day length is less than 12 hours, ex -\\npose the plant to supplemental light.

When combined with \\nday length, temperature also affects the \\nchange from vegetative (leafy) to reproduc -\\ntive (flowering) growth. Depending on the \\nsituation and the specific plant, the effect \\nof temperature can either speed up or slow \\ndown this transition. High temperatures can \\ndamage fruit production by killing the pol -\\nlen that is developing in pollinated flowers. \\nSometimes horticulturists use temperature \\nin combination with day length to manipu -\\nlate flowering. For example, a Christmas \\ncactus forms flowers as a result of short \\ndays and low temperatures (Figure 26). To \\nencourage a Christmas cactus to bloom, \\nplace it in a room with more than 12 hours \\nof darkness each day and a temperature of \\n50° to 55°F until flower buds form.\\nIf temperatures are high and days are \\nlong, cool-season crops such as spinach will \\nflower (bolt). However, if temperatures are \\ntoo cool, fruit will not set on warm-season \\ncrops such as tomatoes. \\nLow temperatures reduce energy use \\nand increase sugar storage. Thus, leaving \\ncrops such as ripe winter squash on the \\nvine during cool, fall nights increases their \\nsweetness. This is one reason vegetables in \\nAlaska are so sweet. Potatoes in cool stor -\\nage also become sweet over time and need \\nto be brought up to room temperature in \\norder for the sugars to be converted back to \\nstarch. \\nAdverse temperatures can cause stunted \\ngrowth and poor-quality vegetables. For \\nexample, high temperatures cause bitter let -\\ntuce and cucumber. \\nPhotosynthesis and respiration\\nThermoperiod  refers to daily temperature \\nchange. Plants grow best when daytime \\ntemperature is about 10° to 15° higher than nighttime temperature. Under these condi -\\ntions, plants photosynthesize (build up) \\nand respire (break down) during optimum \\ndaytime temperatures and then curtail respi -\\nration at night. However, not all plants grow \\nbest under the same nighttime and daytime \\ntemperatures. For example, snapdragons \\ngrow best at nighttime temperatures of \\n55°F, poinsettias at 62°F. \\nPhotosynthesis occurs at its highest rate \\nbetween 65° and 85°F and decreases at \\nhigher or lower temperatures. Temperatures \\nhigher than needed increase respiration, \\nsometimes above the rate of photosynthesis. \\nThus, photosynthates are used faster than \\nthey are produced. For growth to occur, pho -\\ntosynthesis must be greater than respiration.\\nDaytime temperatures that are too low of -\\nten produce poor growth by slowing down \\nphotosynthesis. The result is reduced yield \\n(e.g., fruit or grain production). \\nBreaking dormancy\\nSome plants that grow in cold regions \\nneed a certain number of days of low tem -\\nperature (dormancy). Knowing the period \\nof low temperature required by a plant is es -\\nsential in getting it to grow to its potential.\\nPeaches are a prime example: most va -\\nrieties require 700 to 1,000 hours between \\n32° and 45°F before breaking their rest \\nperiod and beginning growth. Lilies need 6 \\nweeks of temperatures at or slightly below \\n33°F before blooming. \\nDaffodils can be forced to flower by stor -\\ning the bulbs at 35° to 40°F in October.

Because of this, plants may \\nnot get the short day triggers necessary to \\nharden off for winter. Consequently, plants \\nthat would normally withstand cold tem -\\nperature are not winter hardy in Alaska.\\nWinter injury to hardy plants may oc -\\ncur when temperatures drop too quickly \\nin the fall before a plant has progressed to \\nfull dormancy. In other cases, a plant may \\nbreak dormancy in mid- or late winter if the \\nweather is unseasonably warm. If a sudden, \\nsevere cold snap follows the warm spell, \\notherwise hardy plants can be seriously \\ndamaged. \\nIt is worth noting that the tops of hardy \\nplants are much more cold tolerant than \\nthe roots. Plants that normally are hardy to \\n10°F may be killed if they are in containers \\nand the roots are exposed to 20°F.\\nWinter injury also may occur because of \\ndesiccation  (drying out) of plant tissues. \\nPeople often forget that plants need water \\neven during winter. In the spring, when the \\nsoil is frozen, water movement into a plant \\nis severely restricted. These conditions are \\ncommon in Alaska. On a windy winter day, \\nbroadleaf evergreens can become water-\\ndeficient in a few minutes, and the leaves or needles then turn brown. To minimize the \\nrisk of this type of injury, it is important that  \\nplants, especially trees, go into the winter \\nwell watered. \\nWater and humidity\\nMost growing plants contain about 90 \\npercent water.

Thus, direct selling is that under which the \\nconsume r purchases the product directly from the producer.

If the answer to this question is negative then it would have to be \\nreconsidered, in order to fit in to the actual sense that the customer would want to feel.

Consider how rarely they are \\nbeing heard today and how only few people actually mean that when they say it.

During a sale, 55% of the transaction is happening through the body.

Humans are still just another species of animals, which is something \\nwe tend to forget, especially now when living in cities. People learn to respect ext raverbal \\ncommunication. Mostly proposed, is moving the upper body ends, which provides flexibility, \\nand avoiding close movements that ‘tie’ the upper and lower ends and prevent  the essential \\npart of natural communication. It is also suggested to avoid ges tures and hand movements \\nclose to the face, as well as handshakes.  \\n2. Keeping the 55% body movement in mind, errors should be identified.

For the clothing part, it should be assessed \\naccording to the customer’s expectations. Cleanliness and freshness must always be key \\nparts.   \\n3. How the voice sounds is very important (it is 38% of the subliminal message for the sale). The \\nfirst aiding tool during a sale is the voice. It is directly linked to the personality of the person \\nwho speaks and reveals elements associated with the cultural , social and professional \\naspects. The dimensions of the voice are: volume, tone, quality, timbre, melody, intonation, \\nspeed and pronunciation - articulation. In order to use these dimensions the full awareness of \\nthe voice as a sales tool is required, as well as the concentration of the seller to the customer’s \\nreplies. The client is entitled to say whatever they want. However, it is known that choices are \\nreduced from infinite to specific.

In gardens, ornamental plants are \\nusually grown for their flower, foilage, or overall appearance. Useful plants, such as root vegetables, \\nleafy vegetables, fruits, and herbs, are usually  grown for consumption, to be used as colorants, or for \\nmedicinal and cosmetic use. A gardener is someone who practices gardening, either professionaly \\nor as a hobby.  \\nGardening has different scale ranges, from fruit producing trees to large plantations wi th one or more \\ndifferent species of trees, from shrubs to herbacious trees. Furthermore, gardening may refer to \\nplants grown in residential yards, including lawn, or even plants grown in in small or large containers, \\nindoors or outdoors. Gardening may be v ery specialized, with only one crop plant species, or \\naccount for a large number of different plants in mixed plantings. \\nIt is an active participation in the development of plants, and \\ntends to be of intenstive labor, which differentiates it from \\nfarming o r forestry.  \\n \\n  ', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/RAI_1/pdf3.pdf', 'page': 138}),\n",

Forest gardens originate from prehistoric times, over riverbanks, jungles, and wetlands on \\nthe foothills of monsoons. Over the gradual process of improving the family circle, useful species of  \\ntres and v ines were discovered, protected and imporved, while unwanted species were extinct. \\nEventually, allien species were also selected and embodied the gardens.  \\nAfter the emergence of the first civilizations, wealthy individuals began to create gardens for purel y \\naesthetic reasons.

In the 18th century, \\ngardens remained a privilege of the upper class. B y the next century, gardens were also available to \\nthe middle class too.  \\n \\n2.3. Types of gardening  \\n \\nResidential gardening takes place near the house premises, in an area referred to as a garden, \\ntypically located on land and near the residence. It may also be located on a roof, a balcony, a box \\nby the window, a patio, or even in a viviarium. Gardening is  also practiced in non -residencial green \\nareas, such as parks, public or partly public gardens (botanical or zoological gardens), or even \\namusement parks, along transportation corridors and around tourist attractions or hotel gardens. In \\nthese cases, a gro up of gardeners or maintenance people preserve these gardens.  \\n\\uf0b7 Indoor Gardening  is concerned with indoors growing plants, within  a residence , a building, or \\nmore professionaly in a greenhouse.

For  following years, our goals are to \\ncontinue  improving the program by selling plots earl ier in the year and doing more \\neducation/socialization  events. Other improvements woul d be to mulch the pathways early to reduce \\nweeds, develop a  set of rules for the gardeners (i.e. a “weedin g’’ deposit that can be kept if possible \\ndo not weed), and deadlines for people to plant.

Our campus Foundation had purchased \\na large  parcel of property where a high school had been torn  down. It was close to campus and \\nwould have been  highly visibl e. However, there was no water available.  The university has had to \\ncut its budget, so the property  will likely be sold in a few years.

            "ANSWER: \"Taxonomy is a system used by biologists to classify living organisms based on their morphological, physiological, and reproductive characteristics. It involves separating organisms into groups, with the main taxonomic groups including kingdom, phylum, class, family, gender, and kind. Taxonomy helps in studying organisms and their evolution. Biologists use scientific names in Latin to classify organisms accurately. The classification system has evolved over time, with the newer systems being based on phylogenetic classification to determine the kinship and common origin of species, often aided by comparing genetic material like DNA.\"\n",

            "ANSWER: \"Taxonomy is a branch of biology that involves the classification of living organisms based on their morphological, physiological, and reproductive characteristics. Biologists use taxonomy to separate organisms into groups for better study and understanding of their evolution. Taxonomic groups range from single species to entire kingdoms and include categories such as kind, gender, family, phylum, class, infraclass, and kingdom. The traditional approach to taxonomy, as exemplified by Linnaean classification, has evolved to modern phylogenetic classification, which focuses on determining the kinship and common origin of species, often aided by genetic material analysis such as DNA comparison. Taxonomic classifications are typically represented by scientific names in Latin or Latinized forms, with the first word denoting the gender of the organism and the second word defining its kind.\"\n",

              "3  Taxonomy is a branch of biology that involves the classification of living organisms based on their morphological, physiological, and reproductive characteristics. Biologists use taxonomy to separate organisms into groups for better study and understanding of their evolution. Taxonomic groups range from single species to entire kingdoms and include categories such as kind, gender, family, phylum, class, infraclass, and kingdom. The traditional approach to taxonomy, as exemplified by Linnaean classification, has evolved to modern phylogenetic classification, which focuses on determining the kinship and common origin of species, often aided by genetic material analysis such as DNA comparison. Taxonomic classifications are typically represented by scientific names in Latin or Latinized forms, with the first word denoting the gender of the organism and the second word defining its kind.   \n",

Its usability lies behind the need of separating the huge variety of living organisms \\nfound all over the natural world: from massive -sized wh ales to the tiniest of bacteria. This application \\nof classification provides an internationally acknowledged and usable nomenclature. Generally, it is \\npart of the broader science of Systematic.  \\nAristotle was the first one to gather all the relevant knowled ge of his time, and was able to further \\nenriched that with his own observations, by gathering everything together into scientific groups. After \\n2,000 years, the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus (1707 -1778) managed to systematically classify \\nall three indi vidual nature systems ; Plants  (Regnum vegetabile), Animals (Regnum animale) and \\nMinerals (Regnum lapideum). The criteria for the classification of organisms are morphological. The \\nmain composed groups are subdivided into further smaller groups, those to ev en less small  etc.  \\nLiving organisms that exist in the natural world exhibit a surprising variety, from tiny single -cell \\nbacteria, to medium -sized plants and animals, to the massive sizes of an elephant or a whale.' metadata={'page': 5, 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/RAI_1/pdf3.pdf'}</td>\n",

Its usability lies behind the need of separating the huge variety of living organisms \\nfound all over the natural world: from massive -sized wh ales to the tiniest of bacteria. This application \\nof classification provides an internationally acknowledged and usable nomenclature. Generally, it is \\npart of the broader science of Systematic.  \\nAristotle was the first one to gather all the relevant knowled ge of his time, and was able to further \\nenriched that with his own observations, by gathering everything together into scientific groups. After \\n2,000 years, the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus (1707 -1778) managed to systematically classify \\nall three indi vidual nature systems ; Plants  (Regnum vegetabile), Animals (Regnum animale) and \\nMinerals (Regnum lapideum). The criteria for the classification of organisms are morphological. The \\nmain composed groups are subdivided into further smaller groups, those to ev en less small  etc.  \\nLiving organisms that exist in the natural world exhibit a surprising variety, from tiny single -cell \\nbacteria, to medium -sized plants and animals, to the massive sizes of an elephant or a whale.' metadata={'page': 5, 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/RAI_1/pdf3.pdf'}</td>\n",

              "      <td>Taxonomy is a branch of biology that involves the classification of living organisms based on their morphological, physiological, and reproductive characteristics. Biologists use taxonomy to separate organisms into groups for better study and understanding of their evolution. Taxonomic groups range from single species to entire kingdoms and include categories such as kind, gender, family, phylum, class, infraclass, and kingdom. The traditional approach to taxonomy, as exemplified by Linnaean classification, has evolved to modern phylogenetic classification, which focuses on determining the kinship and common origin of species, often aided by genetic material analysis such as DNA comparison. Taxonomic classifications are typically represented by scientific names in Latin or Latinized forms, with the first word denoting the gender of the organism and the second word defining its kind.</td>\n",

Taxonomic groups range from single species to entire kingdoms and include categories such as kind, gender, family, phylum, class, infraclass, and kingdom. The traditional approach to taxonomy, as exemplified by Linnaean classification, has evolved to modern phylogenetic classification, which focuses on determining the kinship and common origin of species, often aided by genetic material analysis such as DNA comparison.
